<h1>Multiclass Classification Of Flower Species</h1>
<p>
  In this project tutorial we will discover how we can use Keras to develop and evaluate neural
  network models for multiclass classification problems. Primary purpose of this project are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
How to load data from CSV and make it available to Keras.
  </li>
  <li>
How to prepare multiclass classification data for modeling with neural networks.
  </li>
  <li>
How to evaluate Keras neural network models with scikit-learn.
  </li>  
</ul>
